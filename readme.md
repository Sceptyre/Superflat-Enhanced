# Superflat Enhanced
*Shoutout to [Mogswamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mogswamp) and [IBXToyCat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GQ4mac4oN3wl1UdbFuTEA) for bringing awareness to this underappreciated gamemode.*  
  
After seeing some accomplishments of what can be done in superflat on Java edition, I decided to start work on a small addon to enhance the superflat experience on Bedrock.

## Features
- Added a lava bucket trade for 10 emeralds to the wandering trader. Added to the random special trade table (Packed Ice, Bucket of Fish, etc)
- Each wandering trader that spawn with the Lava trade can only do it twice.
- Addon gives you a single oak sapling, sets you to survival, and deops you (disabled commands)
- Access to nether via lava bucket as well as cobblestone, various nether farm and crops, enchanting, and alchemy

## Getting Started
*Alot of these tips are collected from personal play and IBXToyCat streams due to Bedrock unique functionality*
- Begin with planting saplings and plant as many as possible
- Prioritize a mob grinder for the following items:
  - Iron Ingots (Zombies)
  - Glass/Potion Bottle (Witch)
  - Bones (Skeletons)
- Use Iron to create a Bucket and a Cauldron
- Collect water during rain in Cauldron
- Water allows creation of drowned to collect copper and create a lightning rod
- Place lightning rod in pit in order to Pigs -> Zombified Piglins -> Gold
- Use Gold, Apples from Oak trees, a Witch, and Zombie Villagers to cure a Villager and start a Village
- Village now allows collecting emeralds to trade with Wandering Trader for lava and other crops
- Use Lava for Cobble generator, nether portal, automatic iron farms, etc

## Tips
- Bees are so powerful early game. Getting a hive and holding them down with some leads around your farmland allows faster crop farming
- Trees, trees, trees
- Trenches and path blocks help counter and control mob spawns
- Wandering Trader leads to hold onto certain mobs (*cough* bees *cough*)

## To Do
- Maybe some form of achievment tracking?
- Some way to access the End?
